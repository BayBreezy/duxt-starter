# Duxt UI Starter

This starter is created from [Duxt UI](https://duxt-ui.netlify.app/getting-started) which is my personal port of the shadcn-ui components.

This is a nuxt 3 starter.

If you dont like how any of the components look, simple head to the file in the [`components`](/components/UI/) folder and change it to your liking ðŸ™‚.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Install the dependencies
3. `yarn dev` to start the dev server

## Credits

I just want to thank ALL the people involved in creating the modules & packages used in this starter.

The idea of creating copy & paste components came from shadcn-ui, so I want to thank the creators of that project for the inspiration.
